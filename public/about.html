<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m currently learning to code and taking my first steps into full-stack development.<br />
  My background is in the creative side of digital work — graphic design and UX/UI design — where I focused on crafting visual identities and user-friendly experiences. Now, I’m expanding my skills into coding so I can bring both design and functionality together.</p>

<p> I’m excited to keep learning, experimenting, and building projects that combine creativity with technology.</p>
